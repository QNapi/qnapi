either version 2 or (at your opinion) any later version.


QNapi is a tool designed for automatic downloading and matching subtitles for
your movie files. It uses resources of napiprojekt.pl and opensubtitles.com
web services.


Requirements
============
 * Qt version 4.3.0, or higher.
 * p7zip. More info you can find at the website http://p7zip.sourceforge.net


Installation
===========

First check if there's a package qnapi in your distrubution's repository or
on the webpage http://krzemin.iglu.cz/qnapi

If there's no package for your distro, you'll have to compile QNapi from
source. You'll need Qt4 libraries and 7z program, which you can find in
p7zip-full (see http://p7zip.sourceforge.net for more details).

First off, fetch and unpack the tarball:

$ tar -zxvf qnapi-XXX.tar.gz

where XXX is a version of QNapi. Then enter the directory and build makefiles:

$ cd qnapi-XXX
$ qmake

If you also have Qt3 installed, please type qmake-qt4 instead of qmake (which
may be a symlink to qmake-qt3). Now build the program:

$ make

If compilation fails, go to "Compilation Errors" section to look for possible
reasons and solutions. If everything went fine, install QNapi:

$ sudo make install

Now you can run the program with the following command:

$ qnapi

If you will later want to uninstall QNapi, type the following command from
QNapi's source directory:

$ sudo make uninstall


Compilation Errors
==================

If make command throws an error similar to the following:

"make: *** No rules to make object"

It means that Makefile has to be regenerated. To do so run qmake/qmake-qt4
again. Afterwards, if qmake did not throw any error, try to build the program
one more time (see 'Installation' section above).

For other compilation errors please report a bug. (see 'Bug Reporting' section
below).


Integration with file managers
==============================

If you want to integrate QNapi with your window manager, follow instruction
presented below for your WM.

First, check if there's packages named qnapi-kde3, qnapi-kde4, qnapi-gnome
in your distribution. Install them and they integrates QNapi with your
environment for you. If no packages were made, follow the instructions below.


KDE 3.x (Dolphin/Konqueror)
---------------------------

You'll need qnapi-download.dekstop and qnapi-scan.desktop files which you can
get from doc/ subdirectory in source archive or /usr/share/doc/qnapi after
you have QNapi installed.

Copy files to the following directories:
 * ~/.kde/share/apps/konqueror/servicemenus/
 * ~/.kde/share/apps/d3lphin/servicemenus/
 * ~/.kde/share/apps/dolphin/servicemenus/

Or globally (needs a superuser privileges):
 * /usr/share/apps/konqueror/servicemenus/
 * /usr/share/apps/d3lphin/servicemenus/
 * /usr/share/apps/dolphin/servicemenus/

Above-mentioned path may narrowly differ in different distribution.


KDE4
----

The command:

$ kde4-config --path services

will return a list of directories delimited by colon:

/home/user/.kde4/share/kde4/services/:/usr/share/kde4/services/

qnapi-download.desktop and qnapi-scan.desktop files must be copied to:

/home/user/.kde4/share/kde4/services/ServiceMenus/

or:

/usr/share/kde4/services/ServiceMenus/

(globally, needs a superuser privileges)


Nautilus (GNOME)
----------------
You must have nautilus-actions package installed. You'll need
qnapi-download.schemas and qnapi-scan.schemas files, which you can get from doc/
subdirectory in source archive or /usr/share/doc/qnapi after you have QNapi
installed. Copy files to /usr/share/gconf/schemas/ directory and execute
following commands:

$ sudo gconf-schemas --register /usr/share/gconf/schemas/qnapi-download.schemas
$ sudo gconf-schemas --register /usr/share/gconf/schemas/qnapi-scan.schemas

If this does not help, you can also try to import qnapi-download.schemas file
using nautilus-actions-config tool:

$ nautilus-actions-config


Thunar (XFCE)
-------------

Integration with Tunar requires to run the program choose
"Edit" -> "Configure custom actions". In the dialog box press a "plus"
button. New "Create Action" dialog will appear. In this dialog on "Basic"
tab set:

Name: "Fetch subtitles with QNapi"
Description: (whatever)
Command: qnapi %F

You can choose icon from a file (e. g. /usr/share/icons/qnapi-48.png).
On the "Appearance Conditions" tab you only have to check "Video Files".
Then clink OK and it's done.

If you want to have a "Scan directories with QNapi" under LMB, create another
action, type "qnapi %f" as "Command" and on the "Appearance Conditions" check
only "Directories".

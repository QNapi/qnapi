This program is distributed under the terms of GNU General Pulic License;
either version 2 or (at your opinion) any later version.

QNapi is unofficial clone of NAPI-PROJEKT program (http://napiprojekt.pl)
written using Qt4. It's focused to be functional on GNU/Linux and other
Unix-like systems, for which NAPI-PROJEKT is not available. Since 0.1.4
version it has also Windows port. For more information visit project's
website.


Requirements
============
 * Qt version 4.3.0, or higher.
 * p7zip. More info about this program can be found here:
   http://p7zip.sourceforge.net/


Installation
===========

First check if there's a package of QNapi for your distribution:
http://krzemin.iglu.cz/qnapi

If there's no package for your distro, you'll have to compile QNapi from
source. To do this you'll need Qt4 libraries and 7z, which you can find in
p7zip-full (see http://p7zip.sourceforge.net/ for more details).

First off, fetch and unpack the tarball:
$ tar -zxvf qnapi-XXX.tar.gz

where XXX is a version of QNapi. Then enter the directory and build makefiles:
$ cd qnapi-XXX
$ qmake

If you also have Qt3 installed, please type qmake-qt4 instead of qmake (which may be
a symlink to qmake-qt3). Now build the program:
$ make

If compilation fails, go to "Compilation Errors" section to look for possible
reasons and solutions. If everything went fine, install QNapi:
$ sudo make install

Now you can run the program with the following command:
$ qnapi

If you will later want to uninstall QNapi, type the following command from
QNapi's source directory:
$ sudo make uninstall


Compilation Errors
==================

If make command throws an error similar to the following:

"make: *** No rules to make object"

It means that Makefile has to be regenerated. To do so run qmake/qmake-qt4
again. Afterwards, if qmake did not throw any error, try to build the program
one more time (see 'Installation' section above).


Integration with file managers
==============================

If you want to integrate QNapi with your window manager, follow instruction
presented below for your WM.

KDE (Dolphin/Konqueror)
-----------------------
WARNING: Since version 0.1.4 QNapi should automatically integrate with Dolphin
and Konqueror. However it does not integrate, to the following:

You'll need qnapi-download.dekstop, which you can get from /usr/share/doc/qnapi
or from http://krzemin.iglu.cz/qnapi

Copy it to the following directories:
 * ~/.kde/share/apps/konqueror/servicemenus/
 * ~/.kde/share/apps/d3lphin/servicemenus/
 * ~/.kde/share/apps/dolphin/servicemenus/

Or globally (needs superuser priviledges):
 * /usr/share/apps/konqueror/servicemenus/
 * /usr/share/apps/d3lphin/servicemenus/
 * /usr/share/apps/dolphin/servicemenus/

For KDE4:

* ~/.kde4/share/kde4/services/ServiceMenus/

Globally for KDE4:
 * /usr/lib/kde4/share/kde4/services/ServiceMenus/

Above-mentioned directories may differ in your distribution, depends on where
KDE is installed.

Nautilus
--------
WARNING: Since 0.1.5 version QNapi should automatically integrate with Nautilus
after you had installed qnapi-gnome package, proper for your distribution. Restart
of the system (or reload gconfd daemon) is required.

If automatic integration doesn't work or you don't want (can't) install additional
package, you can use alternative way to integrate QNapi with Nautilus:

You need to install nautilus-actions package and qnapi-download.schemas file,
which can be found in /usr/share/doc/qnapi or on QNapi's home page
(http://krzemin.iglu.cz/qnapi). You only need to copy it to /usr/share/gconf/schemas/
and execute following command:

$ sudo gconf-schemas --register /usr/share/gconf/schemas/qnapi-download.schemas

If this does not help, you can also try to import file qnapi-download.schemas
using nautilus-actions-config tool.

Thunar
------

Integration with Tunar requires to run the program choose
"Edit" -> "Configure custom actions". In the dialog box press a "plus"
button. New "Create Action" dialog will appear. In this dialog on "Basic"
tab set:
Name: "Fetch subtitles with QNapi"
Description: (whatever)
Command: qnapi %F

You can choose icon from a file (e. g. /usr/share/icons/qnapi-48.png).
On the "Appearance Conditions" tab you only have to check "Video Files".
Then clink OK and it's done.
